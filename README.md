# RealTimeBusTracker

## ‚úèÔ∏è About:

This project is an animation that uses Mapbox tools to display a city bus location in real-time. The developed code brings current information about a bus location by using asynchronous functions and, the fetch method that requests resources to the server. The current longitude and latitude are shown through a marker on the map. 

This project was developed as part of the activities of the "Profesional Certificate in Coding: Fullstack Development with MERN - The Massachusetts Institute of Thechnology" course.
