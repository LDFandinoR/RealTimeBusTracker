# RealTimeBusTracker

## ✏️ About:

This project is an animation that uses Mapbox tools to display a city bus location in real-time. The developed code brings current information about a bus location by using asynchronous functions and, the fetch method that requests resources to the server.  
The current longitude and latitude are shown through a marker on the map. This project was developed as part of the activities of the "Profesional Certificate in Coding: Fullstack Development with MERN - The Massachusetts Institute of Thechnology" course.   

## 🏁 How to Run: 

Clone this project on your machine and drag and drop the HTML file into the browser. Click on the button 
"Show bus stops between two places" to see the marker move from one place to the other. 

## 🚀 Improvements:

For future improvementes you should considere adding options so that the user can select which route they want to see.
